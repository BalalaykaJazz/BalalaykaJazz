The total experience in development is over 15 years. Since 2020, I have been working with Golang and Python.

In the near future, I would like to enhance my skills in the field of system design and architecture. My dream is to launch an educational project to share my experience in a simple and understandable way.

I like running🏃, arduino📟 and Finland🇫🇮
